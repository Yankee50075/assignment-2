    <h2>Biography</h2>

        My name is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gbologe David Ifeoluwa</span>, and I am passionate about technology, creativity, and continuous learning.
        I have a strong interest in web development, design, and problem-solving. My journey into technology started with a curiosity about how websites 
        and digital platforms work, which led me to explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over time, I have developed a deep appreciation for building interactive, 
        user-friendly experiences.

        Beyond coding, I enjoy reading, learning new skills, and working on innovative projects. I believe in the power of technology to create solutions 
        that can improve lives, and I am committed to growing my expertise in this field. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the digital world 
        while continuously improving and refining my craft.
